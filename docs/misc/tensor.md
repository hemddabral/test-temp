## rank of a vector

Number of basis vectors required to specify a component of a Tensor.

## Tensors of rank 0,1,2

Scalar: tensors of rank 0
Vectors: Tensors of rank 1
Stress: Tensors of rank 2

*Rank 2 tesnsors, can be represented using Arrays. But it is important to note that they are not same as arryas. A tensor is much more than an array, each coponent in a tensor has a physical significance attached to it.*

## Definition of Tensor

A tensor is a mathematical object that is invariant a coordinates system change, with components that change according to special set of mathematical formulae.

In a *m* dimensional space a tensor of rank *n* has *m^n* components, and obeys certain transormation rules.
