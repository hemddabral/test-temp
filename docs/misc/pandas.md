*pandas* is a column oriented data handling API. Many ML frameworks support *pandas* data structures as input.

There are two main data structures in *pandas*

1. Dataframe
relational data table with rows and named columns

2. Series
a single column.

Note: name of the column is not part of the series.

Note:
- elements within pandas dataframe objects can be accessed using python *dict/list* operations
